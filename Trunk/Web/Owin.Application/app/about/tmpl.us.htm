    <h2 class="push-down-lg">Our story...</h2>
    <p class="push-down-md">SportsWebPT began in 2010.   Chris had been practicing as a physical therapist for two years in Southern California.  His friend, Dustin was out of the state for military duty.  While training for a marathon, Dustin began suffering leg pain.  He tried stretching to the best of his knowledge, but could not rid himself of the nagging pain. With race day approaching, he called Chris for advice.</p>
    <p>Over a few weeks of phone conversation and video conferencing, Chris provided advice on stretching, strengthening and proper running mechanics.  Chris tried to search YouTube for specific exercises that would help Dustin, but was unsatisfied with many of the exercise instructional videos available.  Chris decided to create his own instructional videos.  Through advice and instructional videos, Chris was able to use his PT skills to guide Dustin to a complete recovery from his injury.  Dustin successfully competed in that marathon.  Chris realized that technology could create a new forum for physical therapy knowledge to help thousands of people maintain an active and pain free lifestyle.</p>
